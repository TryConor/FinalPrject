            Welcome to my website!
            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p><b>                          My name is Conor McLaughlin,</b> I am currently enrolled in <u>The University of Missouri Columbia.</u>
                 At Mizzou I study in the field of information technology. Information technology is fascinating! 
                Within this field I have learned valuable skills such as coding! Coding is something that I am really 
                passionate about and strive to improve. Currently I am doing work in Python, Html, Markup, and CSS. 
                However, I look forward to applying my skills to other complicated languages like C and C# </p>

                

            <p>
                During my time at Mizzou I have earned the opportunity to be involved in lots of cool clubs and meet some of 
                my best friends. I am currently a Sophmore at the time of creating this website. I hope to look back on this 
                assignment someday and feel accomplished within my field. Three fun facts about me are... I hold an executive position 
                within the Mizzou Engineering Student Council, I play sand volleyball recreationally, and my favorite food is boiled lobster.
